				<br />He is the one that makes sure that codes the features into the game and writes the
				<br />logic of the gameplay. Typically, the game developer has the most extensive background 
				<br />in computer programming.  
				<br />The game designer is usually the person that has the initial idea and vision of what 
				<br />the game should look and feel like. This person will work closely with most members of 
				<br />the team to guide them in the right direction. 
				<br />Another interesting role is the game tester. Mostly, each game will have a team of game
				<br />testers to double check the developers' work. They know the ins and outs of every part
				<br />of the game. Having a background in computer programming is desireable for this position
				<br />because often times, they will have to make suggestions on how to fix a bug that they find
				<br />during testing.
