				<p>With the ever growing gaming industry, video game titles became more and more
				<br />difficult for developers to create. The demand and expectations of the 
				<br />gaming community and esports growing in popularity have caused the cost to
				<br />make a game increase substantially. Where it used to only take one developer
				<br />to create a game when the home computer was first introduced, now it can take
				<br />a team of hundreds and millions of dollars. Some, but not all, team members
				<br />include storyboard writers, graphic designers, play testers, game designers,
				<br />and game developers.
				<br />
				<br />We will be going over some of these roles in the next few pages.
